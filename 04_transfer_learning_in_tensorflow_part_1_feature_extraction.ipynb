    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is taking the patterns (also called weights) another model has learned from another problem and using them for our own problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main benefits to using transfer learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can leverage an existing neural network architecture proven to work on problems similar to our own.\n",
    "2. Can leverage a working neural network architecture which has already learned patterns on similar data to our own. This often results in achieving great results with less custom data."
