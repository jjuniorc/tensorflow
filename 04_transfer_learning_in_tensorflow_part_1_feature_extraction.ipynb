    "There are two main benefits to using transfer learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can leverage an existing neural network architecture proven to work on problems similar to our own.\n",
    "2. Can leverage a working neural network architecture which has already learned patterns on similar data to our own. This often results in achieving great results with less custom data."

    "\n",
    "Callbacks are extra functionality you can add to your models to be performed during or after training. Some of the most popular callbacks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Experiment tracking with TensorBoard** (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/TensorBoard) - log the performance of multiple models and then view and compare these models in a visual way on TensorBoard (a dashboard for inspecting neural network parameters). Helpful to compare the results of different models on your data.\n",
    "* **Model checkpointing** (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/ModelCheckpoint) - save your model as it trains so you can stop training if needed and come back to continue off where you left. Helpful if training takes a long time and can't be done in one sitting.\n",
    "* **Early stopping** (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping) - leave your model training for an arbitrary amount of time and have it stop training automatically when it ceases to improve. Helpful when you've got a large dataset and don't know how long training will take.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore each of these overtime but for this notebook, we'll see how the TensorBoard callback can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TensorBoard callback can be accessed using tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard().\n",
    "\n",
    "Its main functionality is saving a model's training performance metrics to a specified log_dir.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, logs are recorded every epoch using the update_freq='epoch' parameter. This is a good default since tracking model performance too often can slow down model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To track our modelling experiments using TensorBoard, let's create a function which creates a TensorBoard callback for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”‘ Note: We create a function for creating a TensorBoard callback because as we'll see later on, each model needs its own TensorBoard callback instance (so the function will create a new one each time it's run)."
